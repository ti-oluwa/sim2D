"""
Convenience factories for building `BoundaryRegion` / `BoundaryConditions`
objects from a `Grid`, without hand-deriving boundary face positions.

Building a `BoundaryRegion` by hand requires: pulling `Grid.boundary_face_indices`,
figuring out which of those global face indices actually sit on the flank of
the domain you care about, then converting the survivors back into
*positions* within `boundary_face_indices` - which is the indexing
`BoundaryRegion.face_positions` actually expects, not global face indices.
