    """
    Classify every boundary face of `grid` into one of the six `Side`s.

    For each boundary face, its outward normal is re-derived defensively as
    `sign(dot(face_unit_normals[face], face_centroid - owner_cell_centroid))`
    rather than trusting `Grid.face_unit_normals`'s stored sign directly.
    The axis with the largest-magnitude (re-oriented) normal component
    decides X/Y/Z; its sign decides which of the two `Side`s on that axis.

    Every boundary face is genuinely exterior by definition (its
    `face_cell_indices` neighbour is `-1`), so classification is purely by
    outward-normal direction - no bounding-box-extremity check. A face on
    an irregular flank (partway along a fault-bounded edge, or the inner
    corner of an L-shaped field) is still genuinely facing one direction
    and belongs on that side; requiring proximity to the domain's
    bounding-box corner would drop real boundary faces on any non-box-shaped
    field. Every boundary face is assigned to exactly one `Side` - nothing
    is dropped.

    Classification happens in whatever frame `grid`'s stored coordinates
    are actually in. For a grid built with the default
    `apply_map_axes=True` (corner-point/Cartesian factories), that's true
    map/geographic space, so `Side.WEST` means true west. For a grid built
    with `apply_map_axes=False`, it means the grid's own local axes -
    consistent with every other computation on such a grid.

    Convert a `bores.grids.base.Grid` to a `pyvista.UnstructuredGrid`.

    Each grid cell is represented as a **VTK polyhedron (type 42)** built
    from the cell's actual face and vertex geometry. This is geometrically
    exact for all grid types; corner-point, Voronoi, Cartesian, and general
    polyhedral.

    Pinched-out cells (cells whose faces were all suppressed during
    corner-point construction) have no VTK representation and are silently
    omitted from the output mesh. Their data is also omitted from any
    attached cell-data arrays so that array lengths always match the number
    of rendered cells. The cells remain present in the source `Grid`
    object so that physics code is unaffected.


    **`MapAxes`**:

    No rotation happens here. `grid.vertex_coordinates` is already in map
    space by the time it reaches this function as the corner-point and
    Cartesian grid factories apply `MAPAXES` when `grid.metadata["map_axes"]`
