"""
PVT (pressure-volume-temperature) property cache for black-oil simulation.

**Known limitation, inherited from `PVTTable` (not something this module
works around)**: `PVTTable.formation_volume_factor`/`.viscosity` correctly
switch between the saturated and Beggs-Robinson-corrected undersaturated
correlations for oil, but `.db_dp`, `.dμ_dp`,
`.density`, and `.dρ_dp` do not - they always evaluate the raw
saturated-curve interpolant regardless of whether a cell is actually
undersaturated. For an undersaturated cell (`PVTCache.is_saturated[i] ==
False`), `dbo_dp`, `dμo_dp`, `oil_density`, and `dρo_dp` are consequently **not** reliable, they
reflect the saturated-curve slope/value extrapolated to a pressure it wasn't
built for, not the true undersaturated behaviour. This is a table-layer gap
(`bores/blackoil/pvt/tables.py`), not a cache-layer one, and worth fixing
there - `compute_pvt_cache` calls these methods as they exist rather than
silently reimplementing a corrected version it can't validate against the
table's own internals.
