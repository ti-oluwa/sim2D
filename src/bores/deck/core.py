    operator occurrences is paid exactly once per deck regardless of how
    many keywords are subsequently requested.

    **Scanning strategy**: Eclipse keywords always start at the beginning
    of a line, alone (nothing else on that line). A keyword's data section
    is everything from there up to and including its terminating `/` -
    *unless* another keyword line is encountered first, in which case the
    first keyword is treated as bare/nullary (e.g. `ENDBOX`, `ECHO`,
    `RUNSPEC`) with an empty body, and the second keyword line starts a
    new record. This mirrors Eclipse's own grammar without needing a
    hardcoded list of nullary keywords.

    Note:
        If the **last** keyword in a deck has data but no terminating
        `/`, that data is silently dropped (the keyword becomes nullary).
