"""
SUMMARY section keyword implementations.

The SUMMARY section declares which result vectors Eclipse should write to
the summary file (`.SMSPEC` / `.UNSMRY`) for later plotting and analysis.
Most SUMMARY keywords are *selector* keywords: their bare presence in the
deck means "output this vector for every relevant object" (every well,
every region, the whole field, etc.), optionally restricted to a list of
named/numbered objects.

**Field vectors** (whole-reservoir totals, no object list):

- `FOPR` / `FWPR` / `FGPR` - field oil/water/gas production rate.
- `FOPT` / `FWPT` / `FGPT` - field oil/water/gas production cumulative total.

**Well vectors** (one series per well; optionally restricted to named wells):

- `WOPR` / `WWPR` / `WGPR` - well oil/water/gas production rate.
- `WBHP` - well bottom-hole pressure.
- `WTHP` - well tubing-head pressure.

**Region vectors** (one series per FIP region; optionally restricted to
named region numbers):

- `ROIP` / `RGIP` / `RWIP` - reservoir oil/gas/water in place.

**Reporting controls** (`RPTRST` / `RPTSCHED`) configure restart-file /
print-summary mnemonics rather than naming a result vector; they are kept
in this module because they only ever appear in the SUMMARY (and
SCHEDULE) sections and share no shape with the vector selectors above.

    A SUMMARY-section vector selector (`FOPR`, `WOPR`, `ROIP`, ...).

    Eclipse allows an optional list of object names/numbers (well names for
    `W*` vectors, region numbers for `R*` vectors) immediately following the
    keyword, terminated by `/`. A bare keyword with no list (or an empty
    list before the `/`) means "every object of the relevant type" and is
    conventionally written as a lone `/` or nothing at all.

    `parse` returns the requested object list (each entry as a string,

    their original token text), or an empty list `[]` meaning "all
    objects" - never `None` when the keyword is merely unrestricted,

    be activated. `None` is reserved for "keyword absent from the deck".
