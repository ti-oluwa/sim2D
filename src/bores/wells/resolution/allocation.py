`CompiledGroupControls` target allocation. Splits a group's target rate
across its eligible member wells by guide rate, writing concrete per-well
`target_rates`/`control_modes` directly into `CompiledWellControls` in
place for wells whose mode is `GRUP`.

First-pass proportional allocation only: does not iterate to redistribute
a shortfall when an allocated well can't actually reach its share (e.g.
hits its own BHP limit). That redistribution loop is not implemented.
