Well trajectory (deviation survey) representation.

A `WellTrajectory` is an ordered set of `(measured_depth, x, y, z)`
stations, piecewise-linear between consecutive stations. A raw survey
polyline, not a minimum-curvature-interpolated one. Accuracy depends on
station spacing, same as it would for any survey-based trajectory tool.
