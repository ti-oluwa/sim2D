    Compute the effective drainage radius for a well in a 3D reservoir model
    using Peaceman's (1983) anisotropic effective drainage radius formula.

    Peaceman's formula for a well aligned along a given axis uses the two
    grid dimensions and permeabilities *perpendicular* to the wellbore.
    For a well in the Z-direction (standard vertical well):

    ```
    r_o = 0.28 * sqrt[ (ky/kx)^0.5 * dx^2 + (kx/ky)^0.5 * dy^2 ]

    The same pattern applies by cyclic permutation for X- and Y-oriented
    (horizontal) wells, substituting the two directions perpendicular to
    the wellbore axis in each case.

    For the isotropic case (kx = ky = k) this reduces to:

    ```
    r_o = 0.28 * sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) / 2^0.5
        = 0.198 * sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)
    ```

    which matches the standard Peaceman result for uniform square grids
    (r_o = 0.2 * dx when dx = dy).

    If either perpendicular permeability is zero (e.g. a tight layer or shale
    streak), the well has no drainage capacity in that plane and 0.0 is
    returned. The caller should treat a zero return value as an indicator
    that no well index should be assigned to this interval.

    Compute the well rate at reservoir conditions using the Darcy well equation.

    surface conditions via `co = -(1/Bo) * (dBo/dP)`, so applying an
    additional exponential compressibility correction on top of a downstream Bo
    division would double-count the same physical effect.

    phases where no FVF is applied downstream (e.g. a standalone single-phase
    water or gas module that does not track Bw/Bg explicitly), and only when

        Compute the effective well-connection mobility for this injected fluid,
        applying a startup floor to prevent zero injectivity when the reservoir
        cell has not yet been contacted by the injected phase.

        The mobility floor ensures that at early time, when the reservoir relative
        permeability of the injected phase is zero (e.g. Sw ≈ swc), the well
        connection still has a physically-meaningful minimum injectivity. As the
        injected phase accumulates in the wellblock, the reservoir relative
        permeability naturally rises above the floor and the standard reservoir
        value takes over - no explicit switch is needed.

        The effective kr used in the well connection flux is:

            effective_relative_permeability = max(kr_reservoir, η * kr_endpoint)

        and the returned mobility is:

            λ_eff = effective_relative_permeability / μ

        This affects only the well connection rate / BHP calculation. It must
        never be used for intercell transport upwinding, which uses standard
        reservoir-state mobilities.

        :param relative_permeability: Reservoir-cell relative permeability of the
            injected phase at the current saturation state (dimensionless).
            For a water injector this is krw(Sw); for a gas injector krg(Sg).
        :param endpoint_relative_permeability: Endpoint (maximum) relative
            permeability of the injected phase from the two-phase table
            (e.g. krw at Sor for water, krg at swc for gas). For unit-normalized
            tables this is 1.0. The caller is responsible for supplying the
            correct value from whichever relperm table is active.
        :param pressure: Reservoir pressure at the perforation (psi). Used to
            compute viscosity when *viscosity* is not provided.
        :param temperature: Reservoir temperature at the perforation (°F). Used
            to compute viscosity when *viscosity* is not provided.
        :param viscosity: Pre-computed viscosity of the injected fluid (cP).
            When provided, the internal `get_viscosity` call is skipped.
            Pass `None` (default) to compute viscosity from pressure and
            temperature using the fluid's PVT table or correlation.
        :param eta: Mobility floor fraction (dimensionless). The floor mobility
            is `η * kr_endpoint / μ`. Default `1e-3` is consistent with
            typical commercial simulator practice (CMG, Eclipse). Reduce toward
            `1e-4` for tighter reservoirs or increase toward `0.1` if
            startup stalls persist.
        :return: Effective well-connection mobility `λ_eff = effective_relative_permeability / μ (mD/cP)`
            in the unit system used throughout; the caller applies the unit
