    Seed the injected-phase saturation in every injector perforation cell
    so that relative permeability is non-zero before the step solve.

    **Background**

    At t = 0 a water injector perforated in a cell at connate-water saturation
    Swi finds `krw(Swi) = 0` (by definition of the irreducible limit).
    Consequently the phase mobility `λw = krw/μw = 0`, the well productivity
    index `PI_w = WI · λw = 0`, and the BHP-driven injection rate
    `qw = PI_w · (P_cell - BHP) = 0` - regardless of how large the BHP
    constraint is. The saturation transport solver then has no source term for
    water, `oil_saturation_grid` Sw stays at Swi on the next step, and the deadlock persists
    indefinitely.

    The same deadlock applies to gas injection when Sg_initial = 0.

    This function resolves the deadlock by adding a small "seed" delta to the
    injected-phase saturation in every perforated cell, backed out of oil
    saturation (which is always the displaced phase for both water and gas
    injection). The seed value is taken from the `minimum_injector_*`
    parameters; if those are `None` the value from `config` is used as a fallback.

    :param fluid_properties: Current fluid properties at t = 0 (before any time-stepping).
    :param wells: Wells configuration containing all injection wells.
    :param wells_indices: Pre-built cache mapping well names to their perforated cell indices.
    :param config: The simulation `Config` instance. Used to get fallback seed values when the corresponding parameters are `None`.
    :param minimum_injector_water_saturation: Override for the minimum water saturation to seed in
        water-injector perforations. When `None`, falls back to `config.minimum_injector_water_saturation`.
        Must be greater than `phase_appearance_tolerance` to guarantee `krw > 0`.
    :param minimum_injector_gas_saturation: Override for the minimum gas saturation to seed in
        gas-injector perforations. When `None`, falls back to `config.minimum_injector_gas_saturation`.
        Must be greater than `phase_appearance_tolerance` to guarantee `krg > 0`.
    :param inplace: When `True` the saturation arrays inside `fluid_properties` are
        modified in-place and the *same* `FluidProperties` object is returned. When `False`
        (default) copies are made and the original is left unchanged.
    :return: Updated fluid properties with seeded saturations. Oil saturation has been reduced by
        the seed delta in each affected cell so that `Sw + So + Sg = 1` is preserved everywhere.
    :raises ValueError: If applying the seed would drive oil saturation negative in any cell.
        This means the seed value is larger than the available oil saturation, which indicates
        either an unreasonably large seed or a degenerate initial condition.

    **Notes**

    - Only cells where the current injected-phase saturation is *below* the seed target are
      modified; cells that already satisfy the constraint are left untouched.
    - Oil is always chosen as the displaced phase (the phase whose saturation is reduced) because:
      - Water injection displaces oil, not residual gas.
      - Gas injection also displaces oil in the drainage sense.
    - The function does **not** rebuild relative-permeability or mobility grids.
      That must be done by the caller after this function returns.

    Enforce minimum injected-phase saturation in active injector wellblocks

    **Background**

    Even after the one-time pre-simulation seeding performed by `seed_injection_saturations`,
    later time steps can cause the seeded saturation to drop back below the critical threshold.
    For example, if the explicit saturation solver clips it to zero, or if the re-dissolution
    flash removes free gas. Without re-enforcement the injector may fall back into the mobility-deadlock
    described in `seed_injection_saturations`.

    :param fluid_properties: Fluid properties at the start of the current time step.
    :param wells: Wells configuration. Only **open** injection wells with a configured
        `injected_fluid` are processed.
    :param wells_indices: Cache of well indices. Only the `injection` sub-cache is used.
    :param minimum_injector_water_saturation: Minimum water saturation to enforce in every active
        water-injector wellblock. Must be greater than `phase_appearance_tolerance` (see `Config`) to
        guarantee `krw > 0`. Pass `None` to skip water enforcement.
    :param minimum_injector_gas_saturation: Minimum gas saturation to enforce in every active
        gas-injector wellblock. Must be greater than `phase_appearance_tolerance` to guarantee `krg > 0`.
        Pass `None` to skip gas enforcement.
    :param dtype: NumPy dtype used for all saturation arrays (e.g. `np.float64`).
    :return: New `FluidProperties` instance with updated saturation grids.
        Oil saturation is reduced by exactly the delta applied to the injected-phase
        saturation in each cell, oil_saturation_grid that `Sw + So + Sg = 1` is preserved exactly.
        Cells where the current saturation already meets the minimum are left untouched.

    **Notes**

    - Saturation conservation (`Sw + So + Sg = 1`) is maintained by subtracting the seed delta
      from `So`. Oil is chosen as the displaced phase for the same reasons as in
      `seed_injection_saturations`.
    - If `So` would go negative after the subtraction it is clamped to zero and the residual gap
      is silently accepted. A warning is emitted in that case. Callers that want strict
      conservation can normalise saturations afterwards.
    - Only open wells with non-`None` `injected_fluid` are processed. Shut-in injectors
      are skipped.
    - This function does **not** rebuild relative-permeability or mobility grids. That must be
      done by the caller immediately after it returns and before the pressure solve.

    Verify that the initial pressure-saturation state is at gravitational and

    **Background**

    A well-initialised reservoir in hydrostatic and capillary equilibrium satisfies:

    ```
    Σ_faces q_α,face ≈ 0   for all cells, all phases α
    ```

    If this condition is violated it means the initial pressure field and the
    initial saturation/density/capillary-pressure field are inconsistent.
    The simulation will then see spurious artificial flux from the very first
    time step, amplified further once injection begins.

    Common causes:

    - Pressure initialised from a single datum without accounting for the
      capillary-pressure offsets between phases.
    - Density grids not recomputed after pressure or saturation grids were
      modified in the factory.
    - Capillary pressure table inconsistent with the saturation contacts used
      to build the saturation grids.
    - Net-to-gross grid changed after pressure/saturation were initialised.

    The check uses **no-flow Neumann boundaries** on all grid faces (all
    `flux_boundaries` entries are zero, no Dirichlet boundaries), so that
    only the interior pressure/saturation gradients contribute.

        the spurious flux would change the saturation by at most 1e-6 per day, which is
        negligible for typical simulation time scales.
