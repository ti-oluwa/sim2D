Explicit finite difference formulation for saturation transport in a 3D reservoir
(immiscible three-phase flow: oil, water, and gas with slightly compressible fluids):

The governing equation for saturation evolution is conservation of mass per phase:

    ∂S_x/∂t * (φ * V_cell) = Σ_faces [F_x_face] + q_x * V_cell

Where:
    ∂S_x/∂t * φ * V_cell = Accumulation term (change in phase volume) (ft³/day)
    Σ_faces [F_x_face] = Net advective flux from all 6 neighbours (ft³/day)
    q_x * V_cell = Source/sink term for the phase (injection/production) (ft³/day)

Phase Flux Computation (per-phase Darcy velocity, not fractional flow):

    Each phase has its own Darcy velocity driven by its own potential gradient:

    v_x_phase = λ_phase · ∂Φ_phase/∂dir / ΔL_dir    (ft/day)
    F_x_face = v_x_phase · A_face                      (ft³/day)

    where:
    λ_phase = k · kr_phase(S_upwind) / μ_phase         (ft²/psi·day)
    Φ_phase = P_phase + ρ_phase · (g/gc) · Δelevation / 144   (psi)

    Phase pressures include capillary corrections:
        P_water = P_oil - P_cow
        P_gas   = P_oil + P_cgo

    This per-phase formulation correctly handles capillary-driven counter-current flow,
    where different phases can flow in opposite directions at the same face.

Upwind Selection:

    Two-stage upwinding:
    1. Density upwinding: ρ_upwind selected based on pressure difference sign
       (used in gravity potential computation)
    2. Mobility upwinding: λ_upwind selected based on total phase potential sign
       (used in Darcy velocity computation)

    Convention: positive flux = flow from neighbour into current cell.

Gravity:

    gravity_potential_phase = ρ_upwind_phase · (g/gc) · Δelevation / 144   (psi)

    where:
    g/gc = 32.174 / 32.174 = 1.0 (dimensionless in consistent imperial units)
    Δelevation = elevation_neighbour - elevation_current (ft)
    144 converts lbf/ft² to psi

    Gravity drives lighter phases (gas) upward and heavier phases (water, oil) downward.

Discretization:

Time: Forward Euler
    ∂S/∂t ≈ (Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk - Sⁿ_ijk) / Δt

Space: First-order upwind scheme

    Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk = Sⁿ_ijk + Δt / (φ · V_cell) · [
        Σ_faces [F_phase_face] + q_phase_ijk · V_cell
    ]

Variables:
    Sⁿ_ijk = saturation at cell (i,j,k) at time step n
    Sⁿ⁺¹_ijk = updated saturation
    φ = porosity
    Δx, Δy = cell dimensions in x, y (ft)
    h_face = harmonic mean of adjacent cell thicknesses (ft)
    A_x = Δy · h_face; A_y = Δx · h_face; A_z = Δx · Δy (face areas, ft²)
    ΔL = flow length between cell centres (ft)
    q_phase_ijk = phase well rate (ft³/day)

Assumptions:
- Darcy flow
- No dispersion or diffusion (purely advective; miscible version adds optional diffusion)
- Saturation-dependent relative permeability (Corey, Brooks-Corey, LET, etc.)
- Time step satisfies CFL condition
- Pressure field is computed before solving saturation (IMPES splitting)

Stability (CFL) condition:

    max(|v_x|/Δx + |v_y|/Δy + |v_z|/Δz) · Δt / φ ≤ 1

Notes:
- Pressure field must be computed before solving saturation.
- Upwind selection is based on phase potential, not pressure alone.
- All three phase transport equations (water, oil, gas) are solved independently.
  A residual volume balance correction is applied to oil to enforce So + Sw + Sg = 1.
  (This differs from the implicit saturation solver, which solves only Sw and Sg
  and derives So = 1 - Sw - Sg from the constraint.)
