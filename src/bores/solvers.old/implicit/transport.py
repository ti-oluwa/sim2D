    """
    Assemble the inter-cell flux and accumulation parts of the mass-based saturation Jacobian.

    The accumulation terms in the mass formulation differ from the volumetric formulation.
    Since densities are frozen during Newton iterations (they are functions of pressure only
    in the sequential implicit scheme), the accumulation Jacobian terms are simply scaled by
    the frozen cell density:

        dR_w/dSw_i (accumulation) = cell_water_density * (phi*V_i/dt)
        dR_g/dSg_i (accumulation) = (cell_gas_density - cell_gas_density*alpha_Rs_i) * (phi*V_i/dt)
        dR_g/dSw_i (accumulation) = (cell_gas_density*alpha_Rsw_i - cell_gas_density*alpha_Rs_i) * (phi*V_i/dt)
            [from So = 1 - Sw - Sg substitution into M_g]

    Note: the gas accumulation captures all three saturation dependencies:
        M_g = gas_density*Sg + gas_density*alpha_Rs*(1-Sw-Sg) + gas_density*alpha_Rsw*Sw
        dM_g/dSw = -gas_density*alpha_Rs + gas_density*alpha_Rsw
        dM_g/dSg = gas_density - gas_density*alpha_Rs

    The flux Jacobian has a 2x2 block per (cell, neighbour) pair covering
    dRw/dSw, dRw/dSg, dRg/dSw, dRg/dSg. Every flux stream that appears in
    the residual contributes to all four entries:

      - Water residual R_w = -water_density * F_w  ->  dRw/dS terms
      - Gas residual R_g   = -gas_density * F_g  (free gas)
                           - gas_density * alpha_Rs * F_o  (dissolved gas in oil)
                           - gas_density * alpha_Rsw * F_w  (dissolved gas in water)
                           ->  dRg/dS terms from all three streams

    Alpha coefficients (alpha_Rs, alpha_Rsw) and densities are arithmetic-averaged
    across the face to eliminate O(1) jumps when the upwind cell switches at a front,
    making the Jacobian consistent with a smooth approximation of the hard upwind.

    Boundary faces have zero Jacobian w.r.t. saturation (prescribed flux).
