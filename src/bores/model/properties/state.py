      saturations (must sum to 1 in every cell).

      volume.  *Primary variable in saturated cells* (Sg > 0); capped at
      bubble-point Rs in undersaturated cells.

      cells* (Sg = 0, Po < Pbub is not possible, so here Pbub tracks the
      evolving bubble-point as the reservoir depletes below saturation
      pressure).

      standard gas volume. Primary variable for volatile-oil / gas-condensate
      models when So = 0.
    - `water_bubble_point_pressure` - bubble-point pressure of the water
      phase with respect to dissolved gas (Rsw).  Relevant for CO₂ or sour-gas
      reservoirs where gas solubility in water is non-negligible.
